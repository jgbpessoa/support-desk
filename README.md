# Support Desk MERN App

![Screenshots of MERN App](./frontend/public/README.png)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

This project was coded during the course "React Front to Back 2022" by Brad Traversy. The goal was to build a Support Desk WebApp using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React and Node.js). This was my first step towards becoming a full stack developer in the future.
